# GrowCherry application (Fast and local groceries delivery)

This is the **GrowCherry** project from [Hackorona - Creativity will not be quarantined](https://hackorona.in.dev/) Hackathon

## Problem

The coronavirus pandemic created new restrictions that grocery stores and Supermarkets  have to work under pressure : In Israel, a business must not hold more than 10 customers within the same store.

* Due to these new restrictions a large number of customers went through to place food orders through digital platforms, but find it hard to use, especially for elderly.

* Many Grocery stores are unable to accept multiple orders at the same time, and hold a small number of delivery workers. Which leads to high orders delays in deliveries

* At the same time, Local grocery stores are losing their customers because of their inability to make deliveries

## Solution

GrowCherry created a network for Grocery stores that allows customers to shop online in the most  accessible way for elderly and whom canâ€™t leave their homes. Our Network create job opportunities for individuals, while giving local stores the ability to make deliveries using outsource delivery services.

Locally customized a global solution

We at GrowCherry see this opportunity to impact a global problem with a unique local customized solution . By creating a local solution we will create on-going global solution to one of the main problems humanity needs to deal with in times of social distancing, quarantine and movement restrictions.
